  When creating my abstract portrait, I wanted to utilize many of the elements of the original painting. The artwork I drew inspiration from was titled “Cossacks” by Wassily Kandinsky. Kandinsky wanted to emulate the feeling of the Cossacks entering Moscow during the revolutionary events between 1905-1906. Wassily Kandinsky traveled to Munich, where he created “Cossacks, to study at Anton Azbe’s private school and then at the Academy of Fine Arts. He then moved back to Moscow when World War 1 broke out. When I created my self-portrait, I wanted to mimic his idea of forming strange shapes for specific parts of the painting. The main focus of my portrait is the nose and mouth as I wanted them to have an exaggerated outline quite like Kandinsky’s fingers and his portrayal of people. He used very basic shapes to convey his ideas. When making the rest of my portrait’s body, I tried to make the shapes of his eyes, neck, upper body, and hair basic, yet over exaggerated. Another important detail in ”Cossacks” is Kandinsky’s use of bold and thin line weights. For my picture, I used varying stroke weights based on the position of the line or form in the frame. I wanted to make this portrait convey a sense of familiarity, yet also not feel entirely natural, using shapes that we are familiar with while positioning them in an unfamiliar way. I did, however, want to drift away from Kandinsky’s lighter colors, and exchange them for a darker and more muted color pallet. I felt that this choice in color will make the art seem more cohesive and allow the portrait to a natural appearance. At first I wanted to make all of the shapes very rigid, but I later changed this idea to replicate Kandinsky’s use of both organic and geometric forms in the space.
