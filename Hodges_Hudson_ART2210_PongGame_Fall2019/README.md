When I initially thought of my ideas for this project, I went along the path of creating a memory game. I wanted to have something that would primarily interact with the mouse. While I stuck with the interactive mouse plan, I scrapped the memory game in favor of single player pong. For me to make this, I had to do some research on how regular pong was setup with the paddles on the sides. In order for my idea to work, I had to alter the position of the paddle so it would interact with the “X” coordinate of the mouse instead of the “Y” coordinate.  The more challenging sections of the code started to arise when I had to program the collision of the bar and the ball and making the score counter only go up by an increment of 1 each time the ball would bounce off. To create the collision, I just had to create the parameters for the ball to recognize where the “X” coordinates of the lines endpoints as well as having it recognize how high up the bar was. When it came down to the scoring system, it wasn’t getting the display up that was difficult, but how to get the score to increase based on the balls impact with the bar. I tried many things with no success, but I eventually figured out that I just needed to have a small space around the bar where score would equal score plus one.
